# Security Policy

Thanks for helping keep **Deskless** and its users safe.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided for:
- The **latest released** version of Deskless

If you’re unsure whether your version is supported, please report anyway.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** open public GitHub Issues or Discussions for security issues.

Instead, report privately using GitHub’s security advisory form:

https://github.com/Lowcountry-Code-Labs-LLC/deskless-feedback/security/advisories/new

If that link doesn’t work for you, you can open a Discussion titled **“Security contact needed”** with **no details**, and I’ll respond with an alternative private contact method.

### What to include
To help reproduce and fix the issue quickly, include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept is helpful)
- Affected platform(s): iOS / iPadOS / Android
- Deskless version and OS version
- Any relevant logs/screenshots (please redact secrets)
- Whether you’ve found a workaround or mitigation

## Response & Disclosure

- I’ll acknowledge receipt as soon as practical.
- I may ask follow-up questions to confirm impact and reproduction.
- Please avoid public disclosure until a fix is available or we agree on a disclosure timeline.

## Safe Harbor

If you:
- Make a good-faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Only test against your own accounts/devices and data you have permission to use
- Do not use social engineering, physical attacks, or denial of service

…I will consider your research authorized and will not pursue legal action against you.

Thank you for reporting responsibly.
